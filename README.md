# Project Auth

This is a pair programming project which I did with Ati Takrami in the framework of Technigo bootcamp for front-end development. The project aim was to create login function for the registered users and sign-in option for the new users. The user and encrypted passwords are stored in MongoDB Atlas in a cloud. Upon successful login user will see some secret information. 
The technology used: Javascript, React, Redux, Node.js, styling was done with CSS

## The problem

Main problem was connection to cloud MongoDB database

## View it live

The application is alive on Netlify server:
